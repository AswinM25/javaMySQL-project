BOOKSTORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING MYSQL+JAVA
In the digital age, efficient management systems are crucial for the success and smooth operation of any business, including bookstores. The primary objective of this report is to detail the development and implementation of a comprehensive bookstore management system using MySQL for the database backend and Java for the application frontend.
Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this project is to design and build a robust system that simplifies the management of bookstore operations, including book inventory, customer information, and order processing. The scope encompasses the creation of a MySQL database to store all relevant data and a Java application to interact with this database, providing a user-friendly interface for bookstore staff to manage daily tasks efficiently.
Database Design
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is utilized to store and manage data. MySQL was chosen for its reliability, ease of use, and robust features that support complex queries and transactions. The database is designed with the following core tables:
•	Books: Stores information about each book, including title, author, publisher, price, and stock level.
•	Customers: Maintains customer information such as name, email, phone number, and address.
•	Orders: Records order details, linking customers to their purchases.
•	Order Details: Captures individual items within an order, including the quantity of each book purchased.
